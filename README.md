Our main idea of our project is to utilize twitter API to make a qualitative sentimental analysis on the tweets of a certain company and monitor the performance of its stocks based on the number of positive sentiment tweets, the number of negative sentiment tweets and the net sentiment, to show a relation between tweets and a company's stocks. We will be using these data from the API to conduct a qualitative analysis and present the analyzed data on a frontend application. 

The following represents the AWS services of our application.
